# 0. Overview

Pane is a terminal-native utility launcher for modern coding and “vibe coding” workflows.

External usage is intentionally minimal:

```bash
pane
```

This launches a full-screen TUI where users can:

- Search small utilities (“skills”)
- See descriptions, tags, and estimated duration
- Run a selected skill inside the same terminal pane
- Return back to the launcher when the skill exits

The initial flagship skill is **Claude Code Tips Viewer**, which lets users browse a curated archive of Claude Code usage tips inside the terminal.
