# 5. Non-Goals (MVP)

- No background daemon or long-running agent.
- No network-based skill registry (only local manifests).
- No advanced layout engine or multi-pane orchestration inside Pane itself.
- No built-in AI inference; individual skills may call AI APIs on their own.
- No configuration UI (config file only, for now).
