# 1. Goals

## 1.1 Primary Goals

1. Provide a **Raycast-style launcher** inside the terminal with a single entry command (`pane`).
2. Turn idle coding time (builds, tests, deploys, AI calls) into **productive micro-sessions**.
3. Support a **community-driven skill ecosystem** via a simple manifest + executable model.
4. Minimize context switching by keeping utilities inside the terminal pane.

## 1.2 Secondary Goals

1. Be approachable for non-developers who are comfortable launching a terminal app but do not want to memorize complex flags.
2. Start with a strong, personally valuable skill: **Claude Code Tips Viewer**.
3. Ensure that the core is performant, small, and easy to distribute (single binary for macOS/Linux).
