# External APIs

**N/A** – Pane is a local-only, offline-first terminal application with no external API integrations required for core functionality. All data is stored locally on the user's file system.

**Future Consideration:** In Phase 3 (Community & Integrations), a git-based skill registry pattern may be introduced, but this would be optional and not part of the core architecture.
